Change theme name
---------------

1. Search for `'_beacon'` (inside single quotations) to capture the text domain.
   Search for `_Beacon_` to capture all the class names
2. Search for `_beacon_` to capture all the function names.
3. Search for `Text Domain: _beacon` in style.css.
4. Search for <code>&nbsp;_beacon</code> (with a space before it) to capture DocBlocks.
5. Search for `_beacon-` to capture prefixed handles.

OR

1. Search for: `'_beacon'` and replace with: `'awesome-theme'`
2. Search for: `_beacon_` and replace with: `Awesome-Theme_`
3. Search for: `Text Domain: _beacon` and replace with: `Text Domain: awesome-theme` in style.css.
4. Search for: <code>&nbsp;_beacon</code> and replace with: <code>&nbsp;Awesome-Theme</code>
5. Search for: `_beacon-` and replace with: `awesome-theme-`

Then, update the stylesheet header in `style.css` and the links in `footer.php` with your own information. Next, update or delete this readme.

Now you're ready to go! The next step is easy to say, but harder to do: make an awesome WordPress theme. :)

Good luck!
