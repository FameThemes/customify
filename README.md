---------------

1. Search for `'customify'` (inside single quotations) to capture the text domain.
   Search for `Customify_` to capture all the class names
2. Search for `customify_` to capture all the function names.
3. Search for `Text Domain: customify` in style.css.
4. Search for <code>&nbsp;customify</code> (with a space before it) to capture DocBlocks.
5. Search for `customify-` to capture prefixed handles.

OR

1. Search for: `'customify'` and replace with: `'awesome-theme'`
2. Search for: `customify_` and replace with: `Awesome-Theme_`

Then, update the stylesheet header in `style.css` and the links in `footer.php` with your own information. Next, update or delete this readme.

Now you're ready to go! The next step is easy to say, but harder to do: make an awesome WordPress theme. :)

Good luck!
